All files are language prefix / translation. Before being incorportated it is desired to make sure the name is actually what it goes by in that culture. for instance FR_FreCrampon is likely fr/crampon and likely going to be available under api.worship.direct/fr/crampon similiar to api.workship.direct/en/kjv

A script will be built to automatically process these files.
