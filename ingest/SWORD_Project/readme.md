All files are original file names + a prefix capital language code Identified in the translation. Before being incorportated it is desired to make sure the name is actually what it goes by in that culture. for instance FR_FreCrampon is likely FR_crampon and likely going to be available under api.worship.direct/fr/crampon similiar to api.workship.direct/en/kjv
